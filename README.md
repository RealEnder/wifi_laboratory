Issue reports and feature requests will be ignored!

It is not made for newbies.

This skeleton is designed to understand 802.11 protocol and to provide a laboratory environment to test WiFi adapters and code snippets.

There are only a few basic options and no status output.

All additional test functions must be compiled individually.
